# Jumper
Jumper is a game I've made for my computer science class that uses console characters for graphics!

## How to play
In jumper, there is no real goal to reach. The only goal is to survive as long as you can.

During the game there will be bullets flying around. The bullets will slowly progress in speed and numbers.
At any point, if you get hit by a bullet or hit any border, you lose the game.

**When you first run the game, you will be meeted with a screen that says lower your console font size to 5**. Follow this guide on how
 - At the top of your console, right click by the window title.
 - Click on properties.
 - Go to the font tab.
 - Change it from the default of 16, to 5.
 - Press ok and put the game in full screen.
 - Once the game is over, you will have to put it back to 16 to read any fine print text.

(I'm not able to set the console font in source, without invoking win32 methods which only work on windows and are like black magic).
